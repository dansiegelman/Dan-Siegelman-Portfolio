## Technical Writing Work

- In my video work, I often spot mistakes in AI-generated transcripts. I researched solutions and discovered [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), an open-source speech recognition model by OpenAI.
  
  Wanting to learn more, I conducted a small study comparing Whisper—a free service—to paid transcription models. I documented the findings in a report, sharing insights for end-users and some surprising results.

- As Lead Assistant Editor on [True Crime Story: Look Into My Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQDIgwOzSxA), I upscaled dozens of low-resolution images for our program. Some images produced great results instantly, while others needed adjustments to ensure the upscaled versions mirrored the originals.

  This inspired me to write an AI upscaling guide for users of all experience levels. The guide walks users through selecting low-res images and reviewing upscaled results. I upscaled a variety of images exclusively for this project.

- At Anchor NY, I worked with three Avid-based editors using Premiere Productions for the first time. To improve the editors’ experience, I organized our footage as Avid-style multigroups. During this process, I discovered a Premiere audio bug that had never been documented on the web.

  I wrote a user guide for organizing the footage and preventing the audio bug. The resulting workflow streamlined editing and supported timely deliveries.

- On [The Toys That Built America S3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJmQDRVJHQ0), our post team received a last-minute request to crop over 100 hours of interview footage to widescreen. As a solution, I built a customized Avid workflow that enables widescreen cropping without causing project delays.

  I wrote a user guide to document the workflow for our post team, ensuring stability across 12 Avid projects and 50+ interviews.

## Multimedia Work

- After completing my AI Upscaling Guide, I decided to take my work to the next level by creating a presentation on the same topic.

  The presentation offers detailed commentary on upscaled images and specialized troubleshooting advice.

<img src="icons/download.png" alt="Icon" width="20">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**[TUTORIAL: FIREFOX VIDEO DOWNLOADHELPER](https://dansiegelman.github.io/Dan-Siegelman-Portfolio/multimedia/firefox-tutorial)**

- In my post-production work, I used FireFox Video Downloadhelper to extract all kinds of videos for archival use.

  I created a video tutorial on getting started with Downloadhelper to guide users through making the most of this powerful tool.

<img src="icons/keyboard.png" alt="Icon" width="20">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**[PREMIERE KEYBOARD FOR AVID EDITORS](https://dansiegelman.github.io/Dan-Siegelman-Portfolio/multimedia/premiere-keyboard)**

- At Anchor NY, I guided video editors in transitioning from Avid to Premiere. To streamline workflow adoption, I designed a custom Premiere keyboard with Avid shortcuts.

  I developed a visual guide to the keyboard that catalogs shortcuts and provides quick setup instructions.

As a certified technical writer, I translate complex processes into easy guides for users of all experience levels.

I write product reports, instructions, style guides, and any document you need to bring your projects to life. I use multimedia tools to engage readers with screenshots, graphics, and video tutorials. If you can envision it, I can write it and design it.

My career began in the television industry. As a Lead Assistant Editor, I managed project structures, designed editing workflows, and facilitated troubleshooting. My success in these roles hinged on my ability to transfer technical knowledge to a broad range of stakeholders.

As I began documenting my workflows, I discovered my passion for technical writing and decided to pursue it full-time. I now create documentation centered on video software and digital platforms. Currently, I work as an AI Content Writer, evaluating chatbot responses and writing quality reports to enhance large language model training.

On every project, I strive to be an active participant in the creation process, not simply someone who writes everything down. I thrive in collaborative environments with a common goal of understanding our rapidly evolving technology landscape. As video and AI platforms continue to develop, I am committed to documenting innovations and guiding teams to outstanding results.
