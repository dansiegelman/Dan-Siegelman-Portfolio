## Roosevelt Speech: PSTT Transcript


The great fundamental issue now before our people can be thinking is these are the American people think the govern themselves to rule themselves to themselves, I believe. Right? I have promised to them I believe in the right to the people. 


I believe that the majority of the people of the United States will be day in and day out, make a mistake in governing themselves that any smaller class or body of man, no matter what their training, will make in trying to govern.


I believe, again, that the American people are capable of self control, and they're learning by their mistakes. I hold opponents, they fly up to this dump, but they show their real beliefs, by the way, in which they champion every device to make the nominal rule of the people a sham. 


I am not leading this fight as a matter of that expression. I am leaving because somebody must lead. The fight would not be made a fool. 


I prefer to work with moderates, with rational conservatives, provided only that they do in good faith, strive for what does the like. But when made false and take their backs to the light, stick with the second. On November 6th. Every action that I have on the company that we the people cannot turn back on, they must that a why is it would be well, if our people would study the history of a system of thumb on the walls of France for a century and, and one of them have been due to the folly of my people, but the impulse to damage upon reasonable conservatism and reasonable radicals at will. 


You revolutionary friends, listen to men like to go back to my all would have gone well. But the beneficiaries of privilege, the woman we actually having is the short sighted, ultra conservative. And I don't know if that's the problem, that instead of him being a rubbish man, 


they gave him 20 years freedom from all, which brings in reform, the gospel, the borrowing, the political, and then and then the unbridled extremists or whatever it used to blind reaction. And so with conversion and isolation from one extreme to another, if alternations of mild radicalism and unemployment has left, many people went through misery. Don't want to shut that and go may be perfect, but the experiences of other Republicans across the border and go forward steadily, avoiding all while extreme and they are ultra conservative. 


But remember that the root of the problems brought on the revolution, and they all would be revolutionaries. Remember that no one was ever such a dangerous enemy of the people and the freedom of the press when the book wrote this, that there is no danger of a revolution in this country, but that is grave discontent and unrest, and in order to remove them there is need of all the wisdom and probity and the faith for them. And that was what we human, I think we have in our common.
