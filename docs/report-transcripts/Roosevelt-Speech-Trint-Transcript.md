## Roosevelt Speech: Trint Transcript


The great fundamental issue now before our people can be significant. If these are the American people built to govern themselves, to rule themselves, to control themselves.
I believe they are my opponents to them.


I believe in the wake of the people's court. I believe that the majority of the plain people of the United States will, day in and day out, make sure mistakes in governing themselves that any smaller class or body of man, no matter what their training, will make in trying to govern them.


I believe, again, that the American people are capable of self-control and of learning by their mistakes. I hold opponents fail employers to this day, but they show their release by the way, in which they champion every device to make the nominal rule of the people a sham.


I am not leading this fight, as a matter of fact, but I am leading because somebody must lead the fight for not to be made a fault.


I prefer to work with moderate with rational conservatives, provided only that they do in good
faith strive for what does the right. But when they also turn their backs to the light, it's that the scholars I must seek simply action. And I have a fourth company where we, the people cannot turn back.


Oh, they must be steady. Why is it would be? Well, if all people would study the history of a system of thumb, all the woes of France for a century, and it won't have been due to the folly of
her people, but begin to look down upon, we suppose, conservatism and unseasonable radicalism.


Were you revolutionary, France? Listen to men like Deauville and back them up. All would have gone well. But the beneficiaries of friendly suburban reactionary is the short sighted, ultra conservative, turned down go, go home. But instead of him by the rubber stamp, 


They gave him 20 years freedom from all restraints and reform the gospel, the whirlwind of the red, yellow. And then again, the unbridled extremists induced a blind reaction.
And so, with conversion and isolation from one extreme to another, if alternations of violent
radicalism and violent globalism, many people went through misery. Don't want to shut up and go. May we? But the experiences of all other Republicans across the water and go forward steadily, avoiding all wild extremes, and may out of cricket sympathy.


But remember the solution to the problems brought on the revolution, and they would be revolutionaries. Remember that no one was ever such a dangerous enemy of the people. In the freedom of the professed friend Roberts, that there is no danger of a revolution in this country, but that is grave discontent and unrest. And in order to remove them there is need of all the wisdom and probity and deeply good faith vehemence that was left with humanity we have at our command.
