# ENHANCE YOUR IMAGES WITH AI UPSCALING

This guide outlines the AI upscaling process for users of all experience levels. Use this guide to master upscaling and create beautiful, high-resolution images.

## What is Upscaling?

**Upscaling** is the process of increasing an image’s size to enhance its clarity and detail. You may upscale small images to prepare them for large displays like print and video.

## Selecting Images to Upscale

Follow the guidelines below to select the best images for upscaling.

**Image Quality:** Upscale images with clear quality issues like blurriness, pixelation, and color-banding. High-quality images may not benefit from upscaling. See Figs. 2, 3, and 4 for examples of each quality issue.

**1. Blurriness:**

**2. Pixelation:**

**3. Color-Banding:**

**Image Size:** Upscale images larger than 200x200 pixels. Upscaling models may struggle to produce great results from tiny images. See Fig. 5 below.

**Lighting and Composition:** Upscale well-lit images with clearly defined subjects,
ideally with the subjects facing toward the camera. Upscaling models perform poorly with low-light images and faces in profile. See Fig. 6 below for an example of a clearly defined subject.

Upscaling can consume lots of time, RAM, and money. Do your best to find high-quality images and only upscale when necessary.

## Reviewing Your Upscaled Images

While upscaling models can enhance your images, they can also make mistakes. Carefully review the following aspects of your upscaled images:

**Resemblance:** Ensure that your upscaled image mirrors—or at least closely resembles—your original image. Upscaling models often take liberties with their high-resolution outputs.
See Fig. 7 below.
