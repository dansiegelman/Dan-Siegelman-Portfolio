## REPORT: AI TRANSCRIPTION FOR PROBLEM AUDIO

This report compares how three AI-based transcription models, Premiere Speech-To-Text, Trint, and Whisper, perform with clean audio and problem audio.

**“Clean audio”** refers to high-quality audio with clear speech. **“Problem audio”** refers to low-quality audio with clarity issues like background noise and speaker accents.

For this report, each model transcribed a clean audio file and a problem audio file, both three minutes in length:

- **CLEAN AUDIO FILE:** [Barack Obama's 2004 Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMNqdB1QIE) at the Democratic National Convention. The file contains clear audio with little background noise. Senator Obama (he was not yet President) speaks with clear rhythm and diction.
  
- **PROBLEM AUDIO FILE:** [Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhlzdjPGxrs) at Carnegie Hall. President Roosevelt’s Mid-Atlantic accent differs starkly from modern American English. Artifacts and background noise further obscure the President’s voice, making the speech difficult to understand.

The report assesses model performances by comparing the number of mistakes in each model’s transcripts. In this case, **mistakes** include misspelled words, missing or extra words, and grammatical errors.

The report’s conclusion offers insights on using each model.

### Premiere Speech-To-Text

Native to Adobe Premiere 15.4 and later,  **(PSTT)** allows users to transcribe media directly within the program. According to Adobe, the model transcribes English-language audio with high accuracy.
